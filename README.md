## HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Enzo Moreira

I'm 15 years old, living in Brazil, currently attending high school at Senac - RS SÃ£o Leopoldo. I love learning about programming, even though sometimes I don't fully understand everything. In the end, I feel the satisfaction of learning and realizing projects I never thought I could achieve.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently cooking something
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Frontend (HTML, CSS, and JS)
